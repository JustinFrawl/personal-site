      <h3>
        Life Before Programming
      </h3>
      <p>
        Prior to attending Flatiron, Justin developed his love for building quality products during years spent working at a craft brewery in a variety of different roles.

      <p>
        At a certain point it became clear that I needed a change of direction.  Having done limited programming in high school and college I took a prep course for Flatiron that led me to really develop a passion for programming.  I believe that at it's very base, programming is pure problem solving in a similar way to the brewing work I was doing before hand.
